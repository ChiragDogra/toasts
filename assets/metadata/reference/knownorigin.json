"description":"Mixed technique. This is a collection of ten drawings which explores the possibilities of the line in space by using materials with different textures such as acrylics, ink, pastels, oil pastels, charcoal, graphite and graphite pencils. The main idea of this collection is to highlight the pure act of drawing as a development of linear thinking: one line leads to another line like a graphic syllogism.",
